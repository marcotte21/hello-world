I am a verstatile IT professional with over 12 years of experience and a bachelors degree in computer information systems.  I have a passion for development, but limited experience. I have worked in many programming languages, and feel I have an aptitude for it.  I am hoping to use GitHub to improve my programming ability and understanding.
